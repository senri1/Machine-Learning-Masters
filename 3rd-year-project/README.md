# 3rd-year-project
Code and stuff for third year project
Contains varients of DQN, mainly modifications to the Q network involving replacing it with an autoencoder + linear model / neural network.
Idea is to try and have perception (autoencoder) and something to make decision based on perception (linear model/neural network).
